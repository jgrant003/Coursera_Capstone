# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone project for Applied Data Science on Coursera. This Capstone includes mutliple projects which will be listed below

## Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
In this project we cluster neighborhoods in Toronto. The clustering for this uses a k-means cluster model and segments neighborhoods based on the proportion of Franchise Coffee Shops vs Gourmet Coffee shops.

## Identifying Neighbourhoods in Toronto based on Childcare Support
The goal of this project is to identify Toronto neighbourhoods based on the capacity of childcare services available. This will support in decision making for young families planning to move to accommodate their growing family. Additionally, it can be used to identify areas where childcare services are underrepresented.
